SUBJECT: Thanks for the great work

Congratulations, weâ€™ve made a really important step. Great job, we are proud to have such professionals in our team! Could you start working on user authentication next?</code></pre>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Your task is to implement authentication on the website.</p>
<p>Create three pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>One for new users to sign up and create their accounts;</li>
<li>The second is for logging in with their usernames and passwords; </li>
<li>The thrird one is for logging out. Users do not need to send any information, so they should just go to the right URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>As our site is not very elaborate, there's no need to create a special application for authentication issues, this functionality may be made in one of the applications we've already constructed.</p>
<p>Please use <code class="language-python">django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm</code> for your signup handler; <code class="language-python">django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm</code> or <code class="language-python">django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView</code> for the login handler, and <code class="language-python">django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView</code> for logout.</p>
<p>If the login request is successful, redirect the user to the menu page.</p>
<p>If you start the application on your computer with the <code class="language-python">python manage.py runserver</code> command, the sign-up page should be available at <code class="language-python">localhost:8000/signup</code> , the login page should be at <code class="language-python">localhost:8000/login</code>, and the logout at <code class="language-python">localhost:8000/logout</code>. Don't forget to make migrations, as it's necessary for creating the authentication models.</p>
<p>Pay attention that the URLs do not have a slash at the end, so your URL patterns should not have it either. You can redirect <code class="language-python">GET</code> requests to the right page with the help of <code class="language-python">RedirectView</code> if you need to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.views.generic import RedirectView
 
urlpatterns = [
   # some other patterns
   path('login/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/login')),
   path('logout/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/logout')),
   path('signup/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/signup')),
]</code></pre>
<p>Another way is to set up the <code class="language-python">LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL</code> variable in <em>settings.py</em> file and use it.</p>
